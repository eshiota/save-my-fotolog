# Save My Fotolog

Fotolog is closing on February 20th 2015! If you want to keep all your
(probably very embarassing) photos saved forever in your computer, you can
use this simple CLI scrapper made in Node.js.

## Usage

Installing:

```bash
npm install
```

Running:

```js
node runner.js --user=plantas_y_jardin
```

## Todo

* Fetch all comments
* Create browseable pages for each post

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any misuse or creepy
stalking you intend to do.

The script worked for my 152 photos, but I don't know how it'll behave (and
how Fotolog will respond) when scraping Gold popular accounts.
